Ok, there's hope. I have been wondering if I was just kidding myself. Beating myself over the head with the bat delusion. I am hoping she's bored of cats. I'd love another cat snuggler, but if not a snuggler, then a ho-hummer.

Girlie still has issues with doors. Doors themselves are just fine, but&mdash;mind you&mdash;if one of the cats is on the other side, she loses her mind. You'd think steak was on the other side or some other offensive thing (a squirrel?). Just doors or other obstacles. I don't know if it's the cats or if it's just being blocked.

We are still leashed if the cats are lose. I'm using a heavy weight to anchor a leash while I work. She figures out she can't really bolt, so she watches and is starting to be non-plussed. I am hoping she's just the kind who has to get over her curiosity. They have to become old news. When we walk around the house (with the leash), the cats do present themselves, and Girlie is still but watches. It's hard to tell if she's nervous or obsessing. Eventually the cats nap, and when they do, I shut the door to the room and let Girlie have free range.

I do think there's hope. She is a very sweet girl. Excited about being on this planet. Just all around adorable. If she ends up failing Kitty Bootcamp, she'll still be a lovely new family member for someone.
