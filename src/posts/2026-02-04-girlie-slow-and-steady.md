She's a sitter! When exasperated or just needing to take a moment to ponder the complexities of a cat, Girlie sits. 

Walks are getting longer without freezing. Her confidence is growing, but somtimes we encounter the terrifying. Today it was a giant plexiglass (?) horse outside a restaraunt. She wanted nothing to do with that monstrosity.
