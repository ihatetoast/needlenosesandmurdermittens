<p>In full Velcro mode, Girlie won't leave my side even while I rode on the stationary bike. I dump the covers onto the tread so the dogs and cats will find it uncomfortable. I provide a bathmat for them. This has always worked. Until today. Girlie flopped onto the lump and bed-failed or tread-failed.</p>
