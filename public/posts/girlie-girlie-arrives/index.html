    <p>Girlie! On Thursday we welcomed Girlie into our pack. It must have been a shock to her. She left sunny summery New South Wales, Australia, landed in LAX and hung out while Texas was under its deep freeze. Don't let this adventurous face fool you. She was 100% not amused with the cold weather. Out—pee—in. No time for sub-zero (she's an Aussie and uses the metric system).</p>
