# Needle Noses and Murder Mittens

## What?
My 11ty site for my work with greyhound adoption, specifically working with cat-trainable hounds to get them cat-safe or (sometimes) to another cat-free foster family. 

Very much a side side side hustle (the website, not the volunteering), the content will be added before styling since potential adopters and new fosters with cats will have this for a reference.
