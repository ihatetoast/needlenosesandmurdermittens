Girlie continues to make progress and has earned her extra lead length badge. She is still anchored to the weight, but I have two leads. I don't fully trust her, so she still wears the muzzle when the cats are roaming. My fear isn't an attack, but a nip. Even if a nip could be playful, it'll scare the cats. Why ruin a good thing? If I felt she'd bolt, she wouldn't get the extra length. She's earned this because I've seen her just watch the cats as they walk by.

So what is next? I'll leave it this way for a while. She's doing well and can go far enough to visit different beds. I can work, read, or craft without worrying about chaos. I set a mental timer (end of a row, chapter, show?) and entice the cats back into their room to lock them away so that Girlie can roam free. She used to use her freedom to sniff under the door to the cats' room, but lately she just checks and returns.

If you are wondering whether I am being too strict&mdash;being a helicopter mom&mdash;I'm not. I see in her a greyhound with cat potential. Girlie doesn't know if they're toys or friends (friends is always loosely defined, mind you. Maybe tolerated acquaintances). Out there (look over your shoulder) is a family with a cat who wants a greyhoound. If being slow with priviliges, it's because I want her to pass Kitty Boot Camp.

Girlie has discovered real toys, so that allows a great "this not that" opportunity. Good thing, because I want my shoes back. She takes toys very seriously and will stare you down until you throw them to her. Need proof?

There's your proof, your Honor. I rest my case.
