In full Velcro mode, Girlie won't leave my side even while I rode on the stationary bike. I dump the covers onto the tread so the dogs and cats will find it uncomfortable. I provide a bathmat for them. This has always worked. Until today. Girlie flopped onto the lump and bed-failed or tread-failed. 

Girlie is also getting used to pack life. Maybe a little too used to it. She's got a little diva in her and growls when the boys come near her bed. Not always, but just enough that they'll turn around. They know who will stay and who will find a new home. The George and Valentino will let her grumble. 

Cats? Still too curious. Mostly when they hide. I have hope but we are playing the long game here.
