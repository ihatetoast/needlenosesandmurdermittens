Girlie! On Thursday we welcomed Girlie into our pack. It must have been a shock to her. She left sunny summery New South Wales, Australia, landed in LAX and hung out while Texas was under its deep freeze. Don't let this adventurous face fool you. She was 100% not amused with the cold weather. Out—pee—in. No time for sub-zero (she's an Aussie and uses the metric system). 

Girlie is not sure what to make of the cats. She takes a page out of Jurassic Park and seems to be blind to still or slow-moving cats. When they run, however, she wants to chase. Not going to be off the leash inside when the cats are roaming any time soon.
