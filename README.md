# Needle Noses and Murder Mittens

## What?
My 11ty site for my work with greyhound adoption, specifically working with cat-trainable hounds to get them cat-safe or (sometimes) to another cat-free foster family. 

Very much a side side side hustle (the website, not the volunteering), the content will be added before styling since potential adopters and new fosters with cats will have this for a reference. 

## Who

- my fosters (currenly Girlie, and previously Zoey, Candy, Jill, Lil Princess, Ursa ...)
- my bootcamp cats (currently TimTam and Spicy Pie, previously Fat Bastard, Zuni, Sierra)
- my volunteer org (currently Greyhound Adoption Leage of Texas, previously Greyhound Adoption Program: Queensland)
- myself (currently me, previously younger me)
